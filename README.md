# Ontario-Snow-Report

An iOS app that parses websites of ski resorts in Ontario and displays details about what terrain is open all within one app.

For Mt. St. Louis, Horseshoe Valley, and Glen Eden, the app uses the `SwiftSoup` pod to assist in parsing the HTML from their websites. 

There is also a Today Extension and Apple Watch app that display condensed reports for each ski hill.
